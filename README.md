## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v9 or higher) or yarn (v1 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-app.git
   cd my-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This command optimizes the application for production and creates a `build` directory.

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```
